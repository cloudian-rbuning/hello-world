# hello-world
This is the trditional "Hello World" first program repository created in a new GitHub environment.

The best part of this "Hello World" branch is learning about how to create branches and then make changes to the source file before committing them to the main branch. This lets us make edits, test the code, and if everything works alright, commit for use as the main branch of the repository. This branch is more of a development branch and the main branch can be thought of as the "production" branch.
